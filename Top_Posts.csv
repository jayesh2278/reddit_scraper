One of the things that stood out was she was telling a story of a friend of hers that had the Impossible Burger at Burger King the other day and became sick. She said the reason was that her friend was allergic to meat and the Impossible Burger had flecks of meat from the grill on the sandwich which in turn made her sick when she unknowingly ate them. She then told her staff, ""...and this is why they said to make sure to thoroughly scrape the grill clean before you cook the Beyond Sausage, and use the designated spatula.""

The kitchen didn't know I could hear them from the counter but I asked the cashier when she brought me my food to please let the manager know that I overheard what she said and I thank her for being so considerate. 

That kind of conscientious attitude will go far with vegetarians in my opinion. Oh, and the sandwich was pretty good too."

Lost five pounds, saved $90, and learned so much.",bubbleheadbob2000,am1zvk,1475,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/am1zvk/its_been_1_month_lost_five_pounds_saved_90_and/,"My teenaged daughter told me in mid-December that she wanted to challenge herself in 2019 and was going to cut meat out of her diet (except seafood). We discussed it and I told her that I would support her by making at least 3 vegetarian meals a week for the family since her brothers didn’t want to make the same lifestyle choices. I told her I would make sure that there was always an option for her to eat but I wouldn’t prepare a separate meal for her on the nights we were having a meat based protein. She had some birthday money left and asked if we could buy some prepared foods for those nights. I compromised and told her I would split the cost because I felt it wasn’t fair for a 15 year old to have to buy her own food. 

She and I researched different menu items and decided that we were going to avoid meat analogs. We found a lot of Indian and East Asian dishes that were either vegetarian by themselves or had meatless options. I researched different preparations that use tofu or other plant based proteins. I learned about textured vegetable protein and different ways to use it. So when January 1st came around, we were armed with knowledge and ready to start. 

As a single dad, I have to keep a close watch on my budget. My grocery budget is pretty tight since I’m feeding 5 people on one income. Because of that, we rarely have a “traditional” American plate with a meat, starch, and veg. Our meals are generally light on animal based proteins anyway but it’s still a significant amount of money every month. But I found my local grocery store regularly has specials on firm and extra firm tofu (like, two 8-Oz packs for $5 usually). I also found a 16 oz bag of TVP for $4.50. Even just using it three nights a week, that was a significant reduction in my weekly grocery bill. 

Well...three nights a week quickly turned into 6 nights. We were having different curry dishes (Penang, red, yellow, green...), 4 bean chili, baked ziti, and so much more. Tons of fresh vegetables, lots of leafy greens, rich sauces...and the smells! Oh my, the house smells so good with all the new spices! And, my two young sons never complained about missing meat and have even asked if we can have some of the tofu and TVP based dishes again. 

So after one month my wallet is heavier, waist is smaller, and nobody feels like they are missing out on anything. My daughter has started cooking more and spending time with me in the kitchen. And all of my kids have seen that I will support them and help them reach their goals however I can. 

I don’t know what the point of this post is but I wanted to share with someone! "

I went vegetarian when I was 8, then vegan at 17. I’m 27 now and still vegan. It’s something I honestly thought I would take to my grave because I felt and feel so passionately about animal rights and knowing where your food is grown. 

But then.... I got chickens. 

I have two beautiful hens. I got them in July as day old chicks, which means they’re 22 weeks old now. This means any day now, I could have fresh eggs. 

When I first got them I had no interest in their future eggs. I assumed I would give them to neighbors or drop them off in my local community fridge. The more I care for them and spend time with them, though, the more I want to eat their eggs. 

SO I WILL, GOD DAMMIT. 

These eggs will be a labor of love from all of us, and I will be so proud to break a decade of veganism to eat an egg my girls and I made. Fuck my vegan friends who don’t support me, I’m happy to go back to just being vegetarian!"

I knew I was the only vegetarian so while they were talking groceries and meal planning, I was making my own list in order to feed myself. They asked if I needed any items picked up from the store, I said I didn't and explained that I was planning to bring my own food for meals. Upon realizing I'd have to cook my own stuff separately, they (5 meat-eating people) decided to make this 3 night, 4 day camping trip vegetarian.

I told them there was no need, I can handle feeding myself to suit my dietary restrictions, but they insisted. I'm feeling very thankful for these supportive, lovely people in my life and am excited to share some of my camp-friendly vegetarian favorites with them!"

I've had many cravings for some of my favorite fast food (mostly fried chicken and burgers) but haven't caved in once.  I have had meat a few times, mostly a few of my boyfriend's Popeye's leftovers.  I haven't been calling myself a vegetarian since I don't want to claim that term until I'm actually not eating meat as a rule.  

I know this isn't much, but it feels like a really big accomplishment for me.  It feels like my purchasing decisions are finally in line with my environmental and ethical concerns."

Then came Impossible and Beyond burgers that have tried to imitate what real beef tastes like.  This may be great for meat lovers who want to not eat meat, but it’s not great for someone like me to have a veggie burger that tastes like beef. I don’t like these nearly as much and I really can’t eat a Beyond burger. So many restaurants are now serving Impossible or Beyond burgers instead of their previous veggie burger that it has ruined veggie burgers for me."

Like maybe this is what meat should cost?  Maybe we should stop subsiding the destruction of our planet so you can eat meat every meal.  Like idk if meat prices doubled, maybe you could try eating half the meat you used to?  I'm fine with people eating some meat but I think these new prices are a good thing.  It should be a more luxury item, not something you eat every meal.

I went home for Thanksgiving and I'm flexitarian so I do eat meat *occasionally* but I keep telling my parents I really prefer veggie and am happy to cook.  They still keep telling me about all these meat stories and offering me ham and turkey and pork sausage and I'm like pls stop?

All from various ""semi-local"" sources and all very good.

Cue Nestlé: ""If you don't throw those products out and start exclusively selling our crap instead we will take *all* of our products out of your store!""

Nestlé are really a cynical and shitty company and they know it. And they don't care... I hate them with a passion. And if they think I now happily will start buying their shit instead they're wrong! And I hope others will follow suit. But the worst part: even if no one buys these products they won't even care."

481,"Why the fuck are people unable to comprehend the idea that a man can be vegeterian without being ""vegeterianized"" by a woman?? And why is it seen as a negative, but not when a woman is a vegeterian???",GaiPod,krsf0j,1141,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/krsf0j/why_the_fuck_are_people_unable_to_comprehend_the/,"I've only been vegeterian for a couple of months, and up until now it seems like 90% of the people that find out I'm vegeterian are either disappointed or annoyed. Literally the only positive feedback I've gotten was from other vegeterians, everyone else has been either neutral or negative.

Recently a male friend of mine casually asked ""how long has it been since [my vegeterian female friend] 'vegetarianized' you""? (Rough translation from Hebrew). He automatically just assumed it was because of her, and of course she had nothing to do with my change of diet.

Like, am I not allowed to have my own moral compass, empathy and ideology? Is being trying to be a good person reserved to women, and when a man does it you roll your eyes at him, or just assume he has some hidden motive? 

And to top it all off, being a vegeterian is something I try not to let people know about if I don't need to, and still whenever people find out they seem to think I'm looking for attention and positive affermations, and assume I'm gonna start preaching to them, even after I immediately say ""don't worry, I'm not gonna start preaching"".

I'm just so disappointed by my friends, and everyone that surrounds me that happens to find out I'm a vegeterian."
