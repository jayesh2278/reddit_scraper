Though they‚Äôre often forgotten about, vegetables (and some fruits!) can be some of the most exciting things prepared on a grill. Most do not require refrigeration and make perfect companions for off-grid cooking.

For this month‚Äôs thread, we will be allowing more simplistic recipes, so long as clear instructions with ingredients and quantities are given. Burgers and hotdogs will be allowed, but they must be accompanied by a side dish and its recipe. Sandwiches will be allowed if recipes for the condiments and fillings are included (no premade deli slices, please). Bonus Karma points for homemade bread or buns.

So without further ado, let‚Äôs see your bean burger recipes, three-bean and potato salads, kebabs, grilled watermelon and foil pack recipes!"

4,Complicated Vegetarian Cookbooks,vellamour,15ffw8o,73,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/15ffw8o/complicated_vegetarian_cookbooks/,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve been vegetarian for 10+ years. Love it, and I am very well versed in how to make myself a meal and how to cook vegetarian food.

However, I am hoping to advance my cooking skills and knowledge. One of my favorite things to do is watch people cook thru classic and complicated cookbooks like Julia Child‚Äôs Mastering the Art of French Cooking. I would love to cook my way thru her book, but I probably could only eat the desserts. 

Does anyone know of any complicated/gourmet vegetarian cookbooks that I could cook my way thru? Again, I know how to cook, and am instead looking for something complicated, and honestly, probably overkill. The challenge is what is appealing to me. 

Anyway, thought I would ask here. Most of the vegetarian cookbooks I‚Äôve used are for beginners. Thanks!

Edit: Wow! Thanks everyone for the suggestions. It looks like my cookbook collection is going to grow quite a bit. I can‚Äôt wait to look thru some of the recipes for these books. So far I think the one I will cook through will either be The Greens Cookbook or Moosewood."

Used a whole box of pasta, cook until about al dente

For the sauce
5 tbsp salted butter 
5 tbsp flour
2 ish cups oat milk
Gouda
Havarti
Cheddar

Made a roux, added the milk. Season to taste at this point- I used a rosemary and garlic salt, mustard powder, onion powder and garlic powder. When it's somewhat thickened up slowly add cheese of choice (shredded, cubed etc) to make a mornay. Stirred in the cooked pasta when the sauce was set to let it all meld for a bit.

Just a plain and basic Mac n cheese recipe, bit it's perfect comfort food and like how my mom used to make it when I was a kid."

One dish that I need to learn to replicate is Chile Colorado; it is one of my absolute favorite foods that I cannot live without. It can easily be turned vegetarian, but I've never gotten it right. I don't care for the meat in the dish. It's about the Chile sauce. It's my favorite food & comfort food, and I just cannot get it to taste right. This means I always get it from a local restaurant (that makes it with steak) because I can't make it myself. I probably won't be fully vegetarian until I find out how to replicate this dish. It is the only dish with meat that I crave.

What vegetables go best that don't take away from the sauce/stew?

I'd prefer advice from someone who grew up eating this dish tbh."

I have several soups in my old recipe rotation that would be vegetarian except they start with a few strips of bacon and cook the rest in the bacon grease.

Oil, butter, liquid smoke? Does ""veggie"" bacon produce fat when cooked that tastes similar? Or is this a lost cause?"

23,Heartwarming Pav Bhaji,TheGarudaReborn,15673is,214,25,https://i.redd.it/0q9xvh3rbfdb1.jpg,"Recipe follows, but pic is my result from following it the first time tonight. A friend from India told me she misses this dish that her mother would make her, and it really is delicious! We are going to make it a regular thing for sure. I used a premade masala from an Indian grocery, but you can make your own if you feel enterprising -- enjoy!

From Food&Wine

Pav bhaji is a classic Indian street food of lightly spicy mashed-vegetable-and-tomato sauce seasoned with warming spices, serrano chiles, and ginger. Served with buttery, toasted rolls, it‚Äôs hearty enough to stand in for a full meal.

Total Time: 1 hr 10 mins
Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped cauliflower florets 
1 1/2 cups chopped green bell pepper
1 1/2 cups chopped carrots
1 cup chopped green cabbage
1 cup fresh or thawed frozen English peas
1 cup chopped peeled russet potato
6 1/2 cups water, divided, plus more if needed
2 tablespoons pav bhaji masala (such as MDH), divided
1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste
1 1/4 cups unsalted butter (10 ounce), divided
1 1/2 cups chopped red onion, plus more for garnish
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger
2 cups chopped tomatoes
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh serrano chile
1/2 cup tomato paste
2 teaspoons Kashmiri red chile powder or Hungarian hot paprika
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish
12 Soft dinner rolls (such as Martin‚Äôs Dinner Potato Rolls or King‚Äôs Hawaiian Original Hawaiian Sweet Rolls), split, buttered, and toasted

Directions
Step 1
Place cauliflower, bell pepper, carrots, cabbage, peas, potato, 6 cups water, 1 tablespoon pav bhaji masala, and 1 tablespoon salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high. Reduce heat to medium; simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; set aside.
Step 2
Melt 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high until butter is bubbling. Add onion, garlic, and ginger; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, serrano chile, and remaining 1/2 cup water; cook, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, red chile powder, and remaining 1 tablespoon pav bhaji masala; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is the consistency of chunky tomato sauce, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Add drained cauliflower mixture; mash using a potato masher until mixture resembles the consistency of chili, adding water as needed to loosen.
Step 3
Stir lemon juice, cilantro, and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt into vegetable mixture in skillet. Cook over medium, stirring often, until mixture is warmed through, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Divide among 6 bowls; top each with 1 tablespoon butter. Garnish with additional red onion and cilantro, and serve with dinner rolls."

I'm not a vegetarian and I have no experience with this ingredient, but it looks like a good source of protein. I was thinking of making some kimchi stew and replacing the pork belly with the textured vegetable protein.

So let's say I'm simmering the kimchi, broth, etc. Would I add in the vegetable protein dry and let it absorb the broth that way or do the instructions online about soaking it in broth or water prior? Let's say I put it in dry and simmer it for 10 minutes, add Tofu and simmer for 5 more minutes. Would a combined simmer time of 15 minutes be enough to rehydrate it?

It says recipe is required so here's a recipe that I vegetarianized(I think) and made low calorie. It's butter paneer....but Tofu 

1. Freeze block of firm Tofu. Defrost and press. Cut into cubes. For this recipe the freezing part is important 
2. In a pot add vegetarian ghee equivalent, green cardamom and stir fry.
3. Add half an onion and cook till soft.
(optional 14 Cashews if no xanthan gum) 
4. Add two tomatoes and cook till soft.
5. Add teaspoon garam masala, Coriander powder, kashmiri pepper. And stir until fragrant.
6. Put all of it in a blender, add a cup of water, liquefy.
7. Add more ghee equivalent to pot and add 1.5 teaspoon ginger garlic paste, more green cardamom, cinnamon stick, and cloves.
8. Pour in and cook the liquefied sauce. Add a little more water if you want. 
9. Take out some of the sauce and blend it with 1/8 teaspoon xanthan gum unless you used Cashews. Mix it back in.
10. Once it seems good add the Tofu and eat."

I‚Äôve been vegetarian for 19 years and went vegan for 5 years, currently back to being vegan after having dairy products for about a year.

Your responses/stories are all awesome and some are sadly shocking.  

One personal story is I was getting an annual checkup by my regular doctor who is associated with one of the top hospitals in the country, and in conversation I told him I recently went vegan after being vegetarian for a while and he specifically said, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äô You don‚Äôt have to be?‚Äù

Also, I worked for a school district in downtown L.A. at their corporate offices and one girl in the cubicle behind me refused to believe anyone would forgo eating meat and told me it was her main goal to get me to eat meat eventually and that she will see to it that I eat meat.  One morning they had pastries and I said no thanks because I had the feeling she was going to try to sneak me one of those meat pastries where the meat is way inside and it‚Äôs hard to tell it‚Äôs in there and sure enough, before I took a bite, I broke it in half and it had ham in the middle of it.  

I feel glad I‚Äôm not alone in this!

Thank you for all your wonderful answers and stories: they are truly amazing (as well as many are heart wrenching), but I feel like we are a huge family that share a common bond!

At every job I‚Äôve ever held I‚Äôve been the only vegetarian in my office. I was treated like a weirdo and a loner when it came to lunchtime. I was usually left out of colleagues‚Äô invites to lunches and dinners and it led to me really being avoidant when it came to get togethers since they always revolved around food, and almost invariable the centerpiece of every meal was/is MEAT."

It was excellent for throwing into a stir fry or curry. It was really easy and cheap and upped my weeknight dinner game to near-restaurant level when I used it.

I am looking to find the closest way to approximate this with an air fryer. Obviously it won‚Äôt be identical as it‚Äôs not actually fried. That‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm just looking for something with a chewy exterior and spongy/eggy interior, if it exists. 

There‚Äôs a ton of air fryer tofu recipes out there, but I haven‚Äôt found one for a generic unseasoned ‚Äúfried‚Äù tofu.

Once I started experimenting, I realized how many variables there are, so I thought I‚Äôd ask, since I don‚Äôt have infinite money to fuck around with tofu experiments (but I know I will if need be).

I‚Äôm pretty familiar with cooking tofu, so I‚Äôm specifically looking for air fryer ways to make blank ‚Äúfried‚Äù tofu.

The variables that I‚Äôm fooling around with:

1) Firmness (Soft, Firm, Extra Firm)?
2) Frozen or Not Frozen?
3) Pressed or Not Pressed?
4) Size and Shape of Cut (currently experimenting with thicker cuts so they don‚Äôt pucker and harden as much)?
5) Cornstarch Coating or No?
6) Time and Temperature?

There‚Äôs so many combinations and there may be a success story out there before I spend a million dollars on tofu.

Thank you!"

* Next day strain dal and reserve the water for blending later.
* Dry blend dal in a blender or food processor for a minute. Then add reserved soaking water a little at a time while blending. You want a bit runny/pancake batter consistency. 
* Add spices (the ones listed or your preferred spices).
* Cook like you would an egg or any egg substitute. I like it spread thin in a pan and cooked like a dosa/crepe.

Since it's winter here, it'd be great to slap that between some bread and toast it, for something new and different.

Most of the recipes I've found are either for making pasta sauce or use uncooked vegetables and cream cheese to make a spread.  That's not what I'm looking for.

**In short, I need pre-packaged vegan/vegetarian food that doesn't need to be kept in the fridge and requires little to no cooking/preparing.**   
In the dorms, there's only four pots for the whole dorm building, so cooking is almost impossible when there's ten hungry people at once and only four pots. It would be the best to also have only things that don't need to be kept in the fridge, because the dorm fridge is really small.   
This is where my issues come in: Most places with recipes and recommendations give you things that actually require *cooking*, which is impossible in a dorm with little to no kitchen access, and time to prepare, which is also hard to get with the amount of workload he has on himself, so I'm looking for pre-packaged, easy things that don't require a kitchen or too much work.   
**Things to put on sandwiches, canned stuff that can be eaten straight from the can, pre-packaged meals that are fine to eat without heating them up, etc.**  
This is why I'm asking here - because I couldn't find any other place with vegetarian food recommendations/recipes that *didn't require a kitchen.*

I've been a vegetarian most of my life and never had any health issues caused by it. If anything it's been a boon; I'm much healthier in general than my older relatives were when they were my age.

However I've been hit with some weird non-specific symptoms lately and no one, including me, thought to check my B12 levels When my GP finally did do a test, it was WAY low.

If your blood sugar starts to go up (thanks genes) or you develop thyroid issues (thanks hormones) it can become harder for your body to absorb B-12. The medicines you take to fix the above issues can make it even harder. Nutritional yeast just can't cut it at that point.  
So I'm off to the store to get some supplements today, even though I've never needed them before.  


Just wanted to flag this for other folks- definitely make sure you keep reminding your doctors that you are a committed vegetarian or vegan, because sometimes they forget they need to take that into account when prescribing you meds."

Time needed: 15 mins 

Ingredients: 
Egg noodles 454g
1 head of broccoli 
1 large spring onions
A thumb of ginger 
100 grams button mushrooms 
Half a cucumber 
1 tablet of golden curry 
350g silken tofu 
Sesame seeds
Light soy sauce 
Rice wine vinegar 
Vegetable oil 
Salt 

Method: 

1. Prepare the vegetables. Remove the green part of a spring onion, clean and finely chop. Peel the ginger and finely chop. Drain the tofu and steam in a pan for 5 minutes. Remove and in a dish, slice the tofu. Cover with 100ml soy sauce and 25ml wine vinegar. Refrigerate.
2. Slice the cucumber and in a bowl, add a little rice wine vinegar. Refrigerate.
3. Slice the white of the onion, part the broccoli into florets and slice the mushrooms. In a hot frying pan, heat a good splash of vegetable oil and add the onion and broccoli. Season with salt.
4. Meanwhile, boil the noodles in salted water until just undercooked. 
4. While the noodles are cooking, add the mushrooms and season the stir-fried vegetables with 75ml of soy sauce and 25ml of rice wine vinegar. It's nice to have a bit of char on the vegetables. 
5. Transfer the drained cooked noodles to the frying pan and stir-fry with the vegetables. 
6. Dissolve the golden curry in a cup of hot water. Add to the noodles and stir throughout. Add a few tablespoons of sesame seeds and stir through. 
7. Plate the noodles and vegetables, add two slices of the marinated tofu, spoon some extra marinade over it and decorate the plate with the fresh cucumber slices. Your quick, healthy and tasty vegetarian meal is ready!  

Variations of this dish could be with different vegetables: Pak choi instead of broccoli or beansprouts instead of mushrooms. Vegans can replace the egg noodles with rice noodles. The curry could be swapped for gochujang paste for those who like spicy, hot noodles. You could even add finely chopped, pickled jalape√±os to the tofu marinade."

- 3 cups of vegetable broth
- 1 cup of milk
- 3/4 cup of ground polenta or corn meal
- 3 oz of Goat Cheese
- Basil, Salt and Pepper to taste

For the Ratatouille
- Minced Garlic
- 1 Yellow Squash
- 1 Zucchini
- 2 Roma Tomatoes
- 1/2 Yellow Onion
- 1/2 Red Bell Pepper
- Garlic Powder (I used a garlic powder/herb mix)
- 1 oz of Goat cheese 
- Salt and Pepper to taste
- Sprinkle of thyme
- Bit of Olive Oil 

Start with Ratatouille 
Preheat your oven to 375. Slice up your veggies thin and about the same size. Lay them down, coat in Olive oil and apply the seasoning. Take your minced garlic and spread on the edge of the ramekins, then stack and alternate your veggies inside the ramekins. I did S, Z, T, S, Z, O, S, Z, RBP repeating, but it doesn't really matter. Add Thyme on top, cover the ramekins in foil and bake for 20 minutes, then remove the foil another 20-25 uncovered. 

For the Polenta, boil milk broth, salt and pepper on high, and once boiling, move to a second burner that's on medium. Slowly add in the polenta while stirring, and cook for 30 minutes or until desired consistency. Remove the pot from the heat and add your goat cheese.

I'll tell you how I plated it, but you can do it however you want. I drained the excess liquid from the ramekins and placed them upside down on the plate. I poured the polenta around the ramekins and removed the ramekins. The polenta surrounded the ratatouille and I topped each plate with a bit of goat cheese and basil."
183,Is there anywhere that sells bulk meat substitutes?

I don't really care for most of the popular vegetarian dish styles (mediterranean, Indian food like curries, etc.) They're good every once in awhile but like most families in our area our day to day suppers are soups, stews, casseroles, meat and potatoes or rice, burgers and fries, stir fry, tacos, that sort of thing. Because of that, I use a ton of meat substitutes. For awhile I was making my own ground crumbles from seitan but we started buying the Impossible Ground and the way you can brown it up and the flavor and texture is much more similar to beef so it's much easier to use in dishes. The problem is about the only place in my area it's somewhat affordable is Walmart. I'd like to start doing a little less shopping at Walmart if possible but I'm having a hard time finding anywhere you can source bulk vegetarian foods like impossible ground or similar, daring plant based chicken, breaded chik'n filets, toona, etc. I guess the shipping might be pretty expensive since they'd have to send it on dry ice but I was hoping to find somewhere where the bulk discounts would off set the cost of shipping.

186,Yachae Japchae - Recipe from the Korean vegan,shikawgo,134sroj,202,29,https://i.redd.it/ksyjp50dlaxa1.jpg,"I typically cook a cuisine style over the course of a week and this week I decided to make Korean food in order to use the last of my japchae.

I made yachae japchae from The Korean Vegan cookbook; the recipe below is a general approximation to protect the author‚Äôs intellectual property.

Yachae means vegetables in Korean so grab whatever vegetables you like that you feel would hold up in a stir fry. I used the traditional vegetables for this dish - carrots, onions, bell peppers, and spinach.

For protein I reconstituted dried shiitake. Nasoya has a ‚ÄúKoreanBBQ‚Äù soy meat substitute that‚Äôd work well for japchae.

Finally you need japchae which are also called glass noodles or sweet potato starch noodles. I had about 100g of noodles (uncooked) so quantities are based on that

Blanch 2 cups spinach in salted boiling water ~2 minutes. Immediately transfer to cold water to stop the cooking process. Squeeze out the excess water and set aside.

Prep vegetables. I julienned 1/2 carrot and 1/4 each of red, yellow, and green bell peppers*, and 1/3 c cabbage. Stir fry each vegetable separately in a hot pan with a drizzle of oil, salt and pepper. Set aside in bowl. Add 1/3 of the cooked spinach (I made sigeumchi namul with the remaining spinach, recipe below)

*you could use a single pepper but red, yellow, green add nice color and different flavors.

Cook 1/2 thinly sliced onion, 5-6 sliced shiitake, and 1-2 cloves garlic in a pan with oil, lightly salt and pepper. Cook ~ 5 minutes. Add a few dashes of shoyu with a drizzle of honey. Mix and cook a couple minutes then transfer to the bowl with the vegetables.

While you prep and cook the vegetables boil water and cook the japchae according to the package, usually -7 minutes. When done immediately drain and run cold water over them.

Mix noodles and vegetables. Add a few dashes of shoyu, squirt of honey, sesame oil, salt, pepper, and sprinkle of sesame seeds. Everything is to taste, adjust based on your preference. Japchae is traditionally slightly sweet with a sesame flavor. 

I ate the japchae with napa cabbage kimchi** from the Farmer‚Äôs Market and sigeumchi namul.

**Many kimchi are traditionally made with  anchovies, etc. Look for kimchi marked as vegan. 

Sigeumchi namul (not the author‚Äôs recipe) - season the remaining cooked spinach with 1/2 T shoyu, 1 t sesame and 1/2 clove minced garlic. I added a pinch of gochugaru and a drizzle of honey before topping it with sesame seeds and mix.  

You can find japchae, gochugaru, etc at your local Korean store, sometimes at a Chinese grocery store or on Amazon"

191,Gallete fran√ßais,femininevampire,133iv4d,329,23,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/133iv4d,"Gallete fran√ßais 
Ingredients 
Batter: 
220g flour, 
4 eggs, 
2g salt,
480ml milk

Filling: 
1 onion,
2 cloves garlic,
1 courgette,
1 aubergine,
5-6 artichoke hearts,
150 grams button mushrooms,
200 grams emmenthal cheese,
8 eggs,
Butter,
Olive oil,
Salt and pepper,
White wine,

Bechamel:
40 grams butter,
25 grams flour,
200 ml milk,
Salt and pepper,
Nutmeg,

Method: 

1. Dice the courgette, slice the aubergine, slice the mushrooms, finely chop the onions and mince the garlic. Roughly chop the artichokes hearts. 
2. Prepare the batter: sift the flour into a mixing bowl with the salt and add the eggs and gradually whisk in the milk until smooth. Refrigerate. 
3. Meanwhile, fry the courgette until golden in a a little olive oil and season. Reserve. Season the aubergine slices and fry (or grill) in a little olive oil until golden brown. Reserve. In the same pan, gently soften the onion, add the minced garlic and fry the mushrooms until golden, add a knob of butter and splash of white wine, reduce and reserve. Fry the artichoke until browned and a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan. Reserve. 
4. After half and hour in the fridge begin to fry the galletes. You should be able to get 8-10, 12 inch galletes from the batter. Stack them up on top of each other and reserve. 
5. Make the bechamel: melt butter in a frying pan, add the flour and cook for 2 minutes to make a roux. Gradually add milk and season with salt and pepper and nutmeg. 
5. Preheat the oven to 180¬∞C. On a baking tray, take a gallete and spread a tablespoon of bechamel across the whole diameter leaving an inch of pancake free. Add mushrooms and onions, some aubergine slices, some courgettes, and artichoke pieces. Sprinkle with cheese. 
6. Fold the corners of the gallete to encase the ingredients. You can use a bit of bechamel to stick the corners down. Make a well and add an egg. Sprinkle with more cheese, season and add a splash of olive oil. Repeat the process. 
7. Oven bake until the egg is cooked and the cheese is bubbling and filling is piping hot. Serve immediately. 

I was improvising this recipe so I don't know if I could have done it better but the end result was surprising pleasant. While not even close to the ones I ate in Brittany as a teenager, they still satisfied the urge I has to eat vegetarian galletes and I consider the choice of ingredients to satisfy the tastes of most people vegetarian or non-vegetarian. I get the impression that wholewheat flour might be a good option for galletes and white for crepes. I thought that like a lot of French cooking, the elaboration was fairly long-winded and as I was improvising, I was trying to add a much cooking pizazz as I could. French cooking is hard. If you do it wrong, it sucks. But if you do it right, it is the best cuisine in the world! 

What ingredients would you add?"

195,vegetarians with non vegetarian partners (in a not super vegetarian friendly country) - what are your solutions for everyday eating out / sharing platters / halving meals etc (more info below),heyykatiejean,133m9ni,19,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/133m9ni/vegetarians_with_non_vegetarian_partners_in_a_not/,"okay so this is going to be a little long but I feel like the context is important, so please bear with me. 

so I live in a country (Italy) / city that is vegetarian friendly in certain situations. if the place is young / hip etc you can easily find a veggie option. the more classic restaurants don't tend to have many options though, and if they do it's usually one or two dishes of the regional cuisine that are always the same - gnocchi with a cheese fondue or some kind of very simple pasta. 

also in Italy the classic restaurants follow the 3 course system - usually one doesn't have all 3 courses, but you would definitely have two. but you can choose from the starter, first course (which is a pasta dish usually) and the second course (which is almost always a meat dish). I tend to always have the starter and first course, as there is never an option for me in the second course. 

as you may know in Italy there is a huge love for food, it's more than just sustenance, it's an experience, that you usually share with others, it's often the main event of a meeting or the focus of a hang out. my partner is from here ( I am not) and food is definitely a passion of his, not just the eating of it but the whole experience of it, the sharing, the communal aspect etc. 

when we are at home we don't really have any issues, as he tends to limit his meat and fish intake anyway, and therefore we usually eat vegetarian. he is also a very good cook, so 99% of the time he's the one who cooks the vegetarian dishes as well.

the issue arises when we go out to eat, especially to a nice restaurant, where the focus is on trying the particular foods that are on the menu, there are often tasting menus, or maybe if all 3 of the courses are interesting, many (other) couples would split a second course or a starter, just to be able to try all the dishes. and this is where my partner feels left out. his passion is  food, and we are unable to do those couple things like sharing a dish, or trying something new and different on the menu, cause as I said, these classic restaurants have very little choice for me. 

so often he misses out on trying a dish he's curious about, or he ends up ordering more food than he can eat if he wants to try. I also always have the same thing at these types of restaurants so we're never experiencing new flavours together. we don't get to share our meals, and also I'm usually not even that satisfied cause at the ends of the day I'll have paid quite a lot to have the same 3 ingredient pasta dish as always, and he'll have paid an exorbitant amount if he tried all 3 courses etc..

I know this is quite a particular situation, but maybe if you can see any parallels to your situations, I would really love some helpful tips on how you manage this type of situation. neither of us is happy in this case, and I don't know how we can compromise or find a solution in which we are both left somewhat satisfied. I'd really love to hear your comments, or ideas on what to do here, cause it's been 3 years and I still haven't been able to balance this side of things.

I made this dish tonight and it was so tasty I had two bowls (it was also my main meal of the day as I‚Äôm on an anti inflammatory diet and eat a proper meal once or twice a day outside a smoothie).

Benefits:
Nutrient dense and filling

Protein and good carb rich meaning a satiated belly, and no blood sugar spikes for those concerned with glucose issues

Gluten free and irritant free.


Recipe:

In olive oil, I saut√©ed some garlic and onions. 

Dried onions will do in a pinch.


Added some Celtic salt and a pinch of black pepper, a little oregano and parsley. 


Once that has browned, add fresh dill and tomato passata and about a cup and a half of water along with half a vegetable stock cube.

Separately I had boiled some rice which I added. Along with half a can or so of tinned lentils. 

Leave to simmer for about 10-15.

Added some more lentils.  More olive oil.  A little more herbs to taste. 

Added baby spinach in the last 5 minutes.  Turn up the heat to let the mixture thicken and reduce.  

Final dash of olive oil over plated dish. 

This was so quick, and delicious.  It will be lunch tomorrow, too! 
This would work well as a frozen meal prep.  Would go well with added capsicum, mushrooms, zucchini I think.

If you make it, let me know! And don‚Äôt be afraid to be generous with the dill, olive oil and garlic.

I have questions for those who cooks a lot of times with red lentils. I hope I reached out in the right sub.
Me and my bf cooked a delicious red lentil bolognese. A one and a half days later, we saw that these white stuff appear on the lentils and generally in the ragu. We figured out that might be the sprouts beginings. Or something. We don‚Äôt remember if we saw that when we ate from it the previous day.

Have you ever experienced this?
Is it still safe for us to eat it? (Actually we both ate from it)
Why did it happen??

Thank you!

Edit: The recipe - Red lentil Bolognese

Ingredients:
1 onion
1-2 glove of garlic 
Oil (your choice which kind, we used oregano olive oil)
1 Basilico Tomato sauce (400 gram
3-4 deciliter water (1 or 1 and a half cup)
150 grams red lentils
Salt

Paste of your choice (65-80 gram/person)

Chop the onion and the garlic, then saut√© in the oil. Pour the basilico tomato sauce on the onion and boil it. 
Wash your red lentils out (3-4 times), and if the sauce is boiling, put the lentils in the sauce.
25-35 minutes till the lentils are ready, if the sauce reducec, pour a half a cup water in it. Repeat it if it‚Äôs necessary.
Taste it, and if its need salt, salt it.

The ragu was enough for 3 seperated meal for my bf and me."

in the last couple months i have noticed a change. i never feel full, despite eating good sized portions which i think and hope are balanced. i am no longer craving for veggies, but meat. i don't feel satisfied and i am often stuck wracking my mental rolodex of recipes trying to find one that makes me feel satisfied. 

i really do not want to go back to eating meat. i found it so simple for so long, why has it changed now, and how do i overcome this?"

Recipe from brandnewvegan.com
6-8 Carrots (peeled)
Marinade
1/4 cup Soy Sauce (low sodium)
1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar (Braggs)
1/4 cup Vegetable Broth (low sodium)
2 Tbs Maple Syrup
1 Tbs Liquid Smoke
1 tsp Yellow Mustard
1 tsp Fresh Garlic (minced)
1 tsp Pickled Jalapeno Juice
1/2 tsp Onion Powder

Instructions
Cut and peel carrots to make them ""bun length'.
Boil carrots in water until just fork tender.  About 10-15 minutes. 
Drain carrots, rinse with cold water, and drain again.  Place carrots in a ziplock freezer bag.  
Whisk all marinade ingredients together and pour into bag with carrots. 
Marinate for 4-6 hrs. 
Grill carrots on an open grill, basting occasionally.  
I pan grilled mine with some of the marinade which worked well."

ETA: definition of precision fermentation by agri-food industry worldwide since there seems to be some confusion (this is not a product, brand or process endorsement): nature-identical, animal-free milk that I am referring to is made without the cow. It uses yeasts and fungi to make dairy milk in the lab. Producers claim cow-free, dairy milk has much lower water and energy needs, and have fewer carbon emissions and waste than either cow dairy milk or plant milk. It is shelf stable, lactose-free and nut-free."

Honestly it would just be easier if all *meat* products were labeled, because obviously there are many more food items out there without anything animal-derived.

While food options at restaurants have VASTLY improved since I stopped eating meat at 12, the consideration for us in terms of pricing has not changed at all. 

Example: You go to brunch and want the farmer‚Äôs/all star/house breakfast, or whatever you wanna call it, where it‚Äôs usually pancakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. You say you don‚Äôt want the meat, and ask if you can get fruit/grits/hash browns instead. They tell you it‚Äôs an up-charge, but looking at the menu adding a side of fruit/grits/hash browns costs the same as adding an extra side of bacon. So if you aren‚Äôt getting the meat in the combo, why can‚Äôt you just make a clean substitution? 

Another example: You‚Äôre at a nice restaurant that for god-knows-why adds meat or fish to every damn main dish, and contrary to popular belief, just because you‚Äôre a vegetarian you don‚Äôt always want a salad. You order a $25 pasta without the meat or fish, and unsurprisingly, it‚Äôs still $25. I just find it confusing that the salad section of most menus always has an up-charge for adding chicken, bacon, shrimp, etc. to any salad. So why can‚Äôt other main dishes also have a cheaper base price for the meal, then have the option to add meat as an up-charge?

First of all I want to stress that I don't judge anyone's way of making or consuming food, if you like what I'm not looking for as described in my title I don't judge you. Also, I've been a vegetarian for only 7 months so I'm still learning a lot.

Before going vegetarian I used to watch tons of cooking content on Youtube. Now I still do but I watch vegan/vegetarian stuff. The issue I have is that a lot of big vegetarian content creators tend to use additives and also their content is less (at least in my opinion, once again no judging) about cooking but more  about chemistry in a lab. They blitz everything up and adds tons of powder stuff. I don't say it's bad for your health or anything like that it's just that I don't find any pleasure in doing that, and cooking is a big motivating factor in my life.

To give you an idea of what I like the two content creators I found myself using the recipes from are mostly Gaz Oakley and Nisha from ""Rainbow Plant Life"". They are still cooks and their recipes still give me the pleasure of cooking. But I'd need more sources like that to try and diversify what I do.

I need to eat high protein for training goals, and don't want to rely on protein shakes that are super processed and full of sugar.

So, any ways of using tofu not in Asian cuisine? Tofu is the best source of lean protein I can find. Its not highly processed. It has twice as much protein/100g as beans. Low fat. Good mineral content. But what I mostly eat are various tofu dishes with rice or noodles, which I love, but I want some variety. 

(other sources of protein I use include yoghurts, cottage cheese, eggs and occasionally quorn pieces or fake meat stuff, but I try avoid that)."

* Microalgae hold great promise as a sustainable protein source as they are low in demands for land, water, and resources, yet high in protein content.
* Microalgae boast a high protein content of up to 70% by dry weight, making them a rich source of plant-based protein.
* Microalgae have a fast growth rate, utilize fewer resources than traditional agriculture methods, and can be grown on non-arable land.
* The versatility of microalgae growth opens the door to new avenues of food production in places where traditional agriculture may prove unfeasible, making it a sustainable option for regions plagued by food insecurity.

Who decided these would be ""staple"" foods for us? They are amongst the vilest and most putrid things to exist on this planet. I will never understand the absolute obsession with them. I've tried them multiple times throughout the years and they are just absolutely awful every time no matter how they're cooked or where I get them. Please, for recipe creators, stop. I beg of you.

433,The Joy Of Beets,scarymary79,11b1jsr,0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/11b1jsr/the_joy_of_beets/,"When my son was around 2, and I was a wet-behind-the-ears personal trainer, I made the (somewhat overconfident) decision to go back to school.

I wanted to be able to deepen the level of support and guidance I gave to all my training clients. I wanted to help their insides as well as their outsides. Above all, I wanted to provide an incredibly holistic approach to wellness and so‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶I decided to become a Nutritionist.

Now, if you know me, you know I don‚Äôt do anything by halves. Going back to school was no exception to this rule, so I dove in headfirst and set out to become a Registered Holistic Nutritionist at the acclaimed Canadian School of Natural Nutrition.

It soon became apparent that I had bitten off more than I could chew. The Chemistry module alone was responsible for kick-starting a growing collection of worry lines on my forehead. Yes, going back to school with a toddler while growing my fitness business was definitely tricky, but with dedication and a very patient mentor, I made it through and graduated a few years later.

I truly feel that my RHN designation served me well over the years I was in the fitness industry.

It meant that beyond offering incredible training sessions, I could also design truly healthy and sustainable meal plans that made people glow from the inside out.

I think the best nutrition program I ever offered at my brick-and-mortar fitness business, 10,000 Strong, was a 19-day juicing challenge called ‚ÄúJuice This, Eat That‚Äù.

I honestly think this may have been one of the more popular ones with my clients too. I do recall local grocery stores running out of beets and kale‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶anyway‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶the point is, the juicing challenge I ran all those years ago (2016 to be exact) stuck with me over the years.

In fact, I‚Äôm still juicing today.

I still honor the unprecedented amount of nutritional magic freshly juiced beets and ginger root have to offer.

I still tout the benefits of juicing to friends and family.

I still love the powerful and speedy changes juicing brings to one‚Äôs body.

Bloating? Goodbye.

IBS? See ya.

Inflammation? So long sucker.

Within a week you can turn your health around.

Seriously.

It‚Äôs that good.

So today I am celebrating juicing and sharing my absolute favorite recipes for you to try.

(If you hate ginger however, stop reading now)

The first recipe is one that I believe keeps my livers from turning into stone and my heart from turning to coal.

Let‚Äôs call it Beet Lovers Elixir.

(For you non beet lovers, there‚Äôs an alternate below)

This recipe calls for:

6-7 beets (skin on)
3 lemons (without rind)
1 whole ginger root (skin on)
Coconut water

Simply juice everything with a juicer (not a blender) and pour equally into 4 jars.

Add the coconut water to each jar so you can fill the jars right to the top. The goal is to have very little air space between the lid of the jar and the fresh juice so you can prevent oxidization.

Voila.

Your beet juice is ready to be enjoyed.

In my opinion, this juice is the best combination for liver support and inflammation reduction.

Now, if you just can‚Äôt stomach the beets you can try this concoction:

7-8 lemons (with no rind)
4 apples (skin on)
1 whole ginger root (skin on)
Coconut water

This spicy and sour combo will be your #1 go-to for bloating, inflammation, and misbehaving bowels.

Now look, I‚Äôm no doctor, and this isn‚Äôt medical advice, but if you‚Äôre looking for a way to flood your body with nutrients, maybe have a think about those beets.

Yes, it will look like a murder scene the next time your go poo or pee (thanks Beeturia) but the benefits far outweigh a little toilet terror here and there.

A wise person once told me that if you fill your body with the good stuff you won‚Äôt crave the bad stuff. 

Given that juicing can be absorbed easily and quickly, I can‚Äôt think of a more efficient way to fill yourself up with the nutrients your body needs to thrive."

While there, we were able to try some really excellent food.

One night for dinner, we got delivery from Planta Queen.

https://www.plantarestaurants.com/location/planta-fort-lauderdale/

An upscale vegan restaurant with VEGAN SUSHI. Everything they had there was amazing. There were tom yum/sweet corn dumplings, Bang Bang Broccoli, General's Cauliflower, and more. Just excellent food. We had a dragon roll which is some of the best sushi that I have ever had, period. I want to go back and try more sushi because it's one of the things that I really miss since going vegetarian.

Another place we tried was called SoBe Vegan, which was right on the beach. It's a vegan burger and fries place that seemed a little more geared to the Instagram crowd than I normally like but quite honestly had one of the best burgers that I have ever had. 

https://sobev.com/

Highly recommend both of these place to any vegetarians living or visiting the area.

(Also, we lived on the Cuban coffee locally thanks to a small place across the street from our hotel. SO GOOD!)"

I have wanted to be vegetarian for a long time‚ÄîI remember going vegetarian in 5th grade but being forced to eat meat by my mom (who believed I‚Äôd fall over and die if I didn‚Äôt). I did the ‚Äúgiving up meat for Lent‚Äù thing multiple times because that‚Äôs socially acceptable here due to almost everyone being Catholic. I went vegetarian for extended periods in college, but whenever I visited home my mother would make me eat meat (but she wouldn‚Äôt let me cook my own food either lol).

I‚Äôm currently reading a book that‚Äôs making my stomach turn. Every year I say I‚Äôm going vegetarian but this time, I really don‚Äôt think I can in good conscience continue eating meat. I‚Äôm willing to put in the work of cooking and meal planning etc. My problem is that my country is filled with a HUGE food culture and I feel like I‚Äôm expected to eat what everyone else‚Äôs eating or else I‚Äôm rude. There‚Äôs not as much vegetarian awareness as there is in other places. My SIL is vegan and just brings her own meals everywhere, and I‚Äôve heard people judging her and starting arguments w her (she is practically a saint so she just smiles and keeps to herself when that happens). Even my SO doesn‚Äôt believe I can do it. He likes to order food because we‚Äôre both exhausted from our jobs and I know he‚Äôll be upset if I choose to cook for myself instead. I went on a work trip with my vegetarian boss and there was NO food available for her all weekend (this was a more remote location), or the food was just salad.

I don‚Äôt need everyone to accept me or love me, but I‚Äôm nervous I‚Äôll be severely limiting my social options and ruining existing relationships. Does anyone else live in a similar social context? How have you handled it? What would you suggest?

Edit: thank you so, so much for all the advice. I will respond to everyone this weekend. I‚Äôm from Brazil (specifically the cattle-raising area next to Argentina‚Äîso my family comes from a HUGE meat culture, like a throw a fit if one meal doesn‚Äôt contain any meat culture) and I live in Mexico. Some restaurants have meatless options but some don‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt understand not wanting to eat meat. Social gatherings at someone‚Äôs house often don‚Äôt have a meatless option. Sharing food is a big part of the culture and refusing food is seen as rude.

I genuinely love Mexico but people are more ‚Äúin your business‚Äù than they are in the US (I lived there for a while too), especially older and more traditional people. They comment on everything - weight, age, piercings, hobbies, tattoos, outfits, what they heard you said or did, hair, when you had/will have kids, when you will get married, makeup, how much you drink or do not drink etc. It‚Äôs not even unkind, it‚Äôs a very social thing and this is how people relate to each other, but it stresses me out that there‚Äôs now yet another way in which I don‚Äôt fit in. Younger people are not nearly as judgmental but I‚Äôm mostly around more traditional people atm due to my job and living location.

I think people around me don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm serious about it (‚Äúit‚Äôs just a phase‚Äù, etc). Some commenters correctly pointed out that I do have trouble with anxiety, perfectionism, and boundaries with others. I‚Äôm looking at therapy soon for these and other issues. Regardless, I am committed to vegetarianism (ethical reasons mostly) and have been thinking and reading about it for a very long time."

Then one day I spoke with someone from the caterer's setup staff while she was laying out the serving table, explained my situation, and politely asked if she could please start putting the veggie entrees at the other end, after all the meats. She thought it was a wonderful idea, did so, and it worked! The omnis would see the meats first, load up their plates, and then not have as much room to take the veggie friendly foods! I did have to stand in line in front of a bunch of trays of smelly dead animal matter to get to the good stuff, but I considered that a fair trade for getting any food at all. And the caterer enthusiastically checked in with / bragged to me for weeks after, super proud that we had come to this solution. :)

So yeah, if you find yourself frequently in a similar situation, talk to the catering staff and see if they can rearrange the table a bit. They'll probably be happy to help."

My boss is pretty cool so if we come up with a good idea food wise then there‚Äôs a good chance she will wanna run a trial of it in store.

Pizza? All 4 of the kinds we make have lots of meat on them.

Subs? All 7 kinds of them with meat.

Paninis ? All with meat .

I have so many customers ask me if I have any options with no meat , either for religious reasons or just personal reasons and all I can think of on the spot is a panini with just cheese , so a grilled cheese‚Ä¶feels kinda boring?..

Here‚Äôs where I need your help. 

Give me vegetarian style sandwiches, subs, meals , whatever ! Throw em my way please and thank you and I‚Äôll run trials on some of them to see how they sell !

Thank you kindly for your time !"
479,What's a good plant-based milk for a tea drinker? almond milk 'curdles' when I add it to a cup of tea.,Lihaart,111jsk8,90,119,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/111jsk8/whats_a_good_plantbased_milk_for_a_tea_drinker/,"I've recently tried swapping cow's milk for almond milk, and I'm okay with the taste, but there's just one problem. Whenever I add it to my cuppa, I get these floaty bits of residue on top... it looks similar to what you sometimes get if you're in a place with hard water. Has anyone else experienced this, and do you know if there's a plant-based milk that doesn't do this when added into hot tea? I know it doesn't affect the taste, but it still puts me off drinking it"

I had roasted red pepper hummus and whole wheat tortillas. It seemed boring to have just hummus wrapped up in a tortilla so I decided, hey, I can make a quesadilla

I roasted some grape tomatoes, when those were done I spread some hummus on one tortilla. I added a bit to it. Added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese, the tomatoes, and some pickled red onions, more cheese. Cover with another tortilla, lightly oil the outside of the top tortilla. Put onto an oiled baking sheet, bake at 350F until toasted and the cheese is melty

Roasted red hummus is my favorite and the flavor of that specifically was great in a quesadilla"

I‚Äôm otherwise pretty healthy and only 28 but both of my parents have it, as well as my both of my grandfathers (now deceased from heart disease). My doctor is strongly recommending I start the Mediterranean diet. I want to, but can it be possible being a vegetarian? 


I am allergic to avocados, strawberries, and almonds. (latex allergy) 

Have any of you tried it? I‚Äôm worried about having to give up tofu.





Edit: 

Thanks for all of these great responses. I do have anemia (have had it before in the past). With both of my grandparents sudden deaths in their 50s from heart disease, my doctor is strongly encouraging this. I am not very overweight (just 15-18 pounds) and can definitely use more exercise. I work from home so I can stay sedentary a lot. These are really great responses and I am excited to make this change ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

492,Veggie Burger,improvmama101,10xzkh1,75,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/10xzkh1/veggie_burger/,"I work at a locally owned restaurant and we have burger week coming up in our area. I have been chosen to create our special burger and I‚Äôve been given the green light to make it a veggie burger! 

My typical recipe at home is smashed black beans, spices, eggs and crackers. I‚Äôll likely do something similar but I was curious if anyone had any favorite recipes. I‚Äôm considering adding freshly diced onions or other veggies. I‚Äôm in Kentucky, so it would also be cool if I could spotlight local produce. We do that a lot where I work. 

I‚Äôm going to make the veggie burgers in bulk, patty them and freeze them. Then they‚Äôll be cooked from frozen on the flat top.

Edit: I typically only use eggs in my recipe at home when I‚Äôm cooking for guests because the egg helps to keep it together. I don‚Äôt personally mind a crumbly black bean burger. There are some non-egg suggestions below that I will definitely test out! Thanks for all the feedback! I‚Äôll be doing some test burgers at work tomorrow.

Edit #2 I‚Äôm in an area where vegan and gluten free are often turn offs. We have a DELICIOUS vegan and gluten free dessert, but if you tell the customer it‚Äôs vegan or gluten free before they order it, 99 times out of 100, they won‚Äôt get it. We call it our PB Bliss. It‚Äôs Rice Krispies, sugar, vegan butter, peanut butter and a chocolate drizzle. So. Good. But as soon as they hear vegan, their turn their nose up. So while I‚Äôm happy to create and sell a vegan burger, we‚Äôll still advertise it as vegetarian. It will just sell better."

It is a bit holistic as I did not measure things.

It looks poopy brown, thus I do not have a picture.

It is surprisingly strong smelling.

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

Yukon potato 4-6, diced. ( I read that these are the best in a dish like this. Forget why)

gouda (shredded) 1-5 cups depending on how much you value pooping.

bag frozen corn

white beans - 1 can

veggie broth

black beans - 1 can

cumin ( Be creative here!)

salt, pepper

celery (about 5) diced

carrots (about 5) diced

1 onion (and half of a rotting green onion)

can of green chiles

&#x200B;

**Instructions:**

Toss in Instapot, pressure cook for 24 minutes. 

Neglect for hours, is perfectly fine.
